S. Lewis que se transmitieron durante tiempos de guerra, charlas en las cuales él se proponía \"\"explicar y defender las creencias que han sido común a casi todos los cristianos de todos los tiempos.\"\" Rechazando los límites que dividen las distintas denominaciones del cristianismo, C. S. Lewis ofrece una inigualable oportunidad al creyente y al no creyente para escuchar un argumento fuerte y racional para la fe cristiana. Esta es una colección de la genialidad de Lewis que aún se mantiene viva para el lector moderno y que a la vez confirma su reputación como el escritor y pensador más importante de nuestros tiempos. Mero Cristianismo es su libro más popular y ha vendido millones de ejemplares a través del mundo.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1069006","name":"C.S.
